== Frequently Asked Questions ==
= Q. Will this Plugin work on my WordPress.COM website? =
A. Sorry, this plugin is available for use only on self-hosted (WordPress.org) websites.

A. Yes. But If your language is not available then you can make one. This plugin is ready for translation. The `.pot` file is included and placed in "`languages`" folder. Many of plugin users would be delighted if you shared your translation with the community. Just send the translation files (`*.po, *.mo`) to me at the arthurgareginyan@gmail.com and I will include the translation within the next plugin update.

= Q. How much of scripts I can enter in the field? =
A. I don't limit the number of characters.

= Q. Does this plugin require modification to the theme? =

A. As with every plugin, it's possible that things don't work. The most common reason for this is that the plugin has a conflict with another plugin you're using. It's impossible to tell what could be wrong exactly, but if you post a support request in the plugin's support forum on WordPress.org, I'd be happy to give it a look and try to help out.
